    "Dr. Harris: I understand. Let me quickly confirm some things before we dive deeper. You're 67 years old, retired from construction, and living alone, correct?\n",
    "José Garcia: Yes, that's right.\n",
    "Dr. Harris: And you still have type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and stage 3 chronic kidney disease. Am I missing anything?\n",
    "José Garcia: No, you got it all. And the diabetes has been there for about 15 years now.\n",
    "Dr. Harris: Got it. Any changes recently in your diet or your daily routine?\n",
    "José Garcia: Honestly, transportation is still tough, and sometimes I skip meals because it's hard getting to the grocery store. Money can be tight, you know.\n",
    "Dr. Harris: I completely understand; thanks for letting me know. This matters a lot for your overall health. How about medications—still on Metformin, Lisinopril, Atorvastatin, Gabapentin, and Aspirin?\n",
    "José Garcia: Yeah, exactly those. Haven't missed doses, but the Gabapentin doesn't seem to help with the foot pain anymore.\n",
    "Dr. Harris: Alright. Nurse Kelly will take your vitals quickly, then we'll check out your foot.\n",
    "(Nurse Kelly takes vital signs.)\n",
    "Nurse Kelly: Your blood pressure is 148 over 88, heart rate 80, oxygen is good at 96%, and your weight today is 82 kilos.\n",
    "Dr. Harris: Your blood pressure is a bit high today, José. We'll keep an eye on that. How's your blood sugar management lately?\n",
    "José Garcia: It's not great, honestly. The last A1C was about 8.2%. I admit, I've had some trouble controlling it.\n",
    "Dr. Harris: Thanks for being honest about that. Let's check your feet. (Examines feet) Hmm, your pulses are a bit weak, and your sensation is reduced in your toes. There's no open wound, but there are some calluses.\n",
    "José Garcia: Is that what's causing the burning feeling?\n",
    "Dr. Harris: Yes, it's likely due to diabetic neuropathy. This happens when high sugars damage nerves over time. I'll prescribe Duloxetine—it can help manage nerve pain more effectively.\n",
    "José Garcia: Sounds good, doc. Anything else I should do?\n",
    "Dr. Harris: Yes, I'd like you to see a podiatrist. They'll manage those calluses and teach you foot care. Also, I want to involve our care manager, Mrs. Lee. She can help you access better transportation and some meal support programs.\n",
    "(Mrs. Lee, care manager, joins briefly.)\n",
    "Mrs. Lee: Hi José! I'll call you each week to see how your blood sugars are doing and help arrange transportation and meals. Would that be helpful?\n",
